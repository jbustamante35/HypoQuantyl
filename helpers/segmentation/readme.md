# Segmentation
This folder is dedicated to the series of scripts that Nathan and I wrote
during the particularly productive week of 10.01.2019 to 10-04.2019, when we
decided to completely restructure the way the neural net based segmentation
algorithm will work.

It implements our new nomenclature of fiber bundles and tangent spaces, and
throws away many of my old methods for doing things.

As of 10.04.2019, the scripts are still messy and under production, so I didn't
want to add them to the main repository helper functions. But I still wanted
them accessible from my MATLAB path, so I added them to their own directory
in the HypoQuantyl repository.
